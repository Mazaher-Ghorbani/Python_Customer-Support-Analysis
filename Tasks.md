## Task

Imagine you are an "Operations Data Analyst" and the Operations Extended Leadership Team has tasked you to do an analysis for them.

### 1. Customer Service Overview

You'll first want to give a *high-level* overview of what happened in Customer Service, based on the given data. Pick a set of (at least 3) KPIs you deem appropriate and visualise their development. *Hint:* In this sub-task, restrict yourself to **contacts, specialists, surveys**.


### 2. CS Specialists.

Create weekly leaderboards: breakdown per week for the top 5 inhouse CS specialists with respect to 3 KPIs that you think are suitable for measuring specialist performance. Plot the leaderboards showing full names and scores. 

*Notes: Let's say a week starts on Monday and has 7 days. Let's only consider weeks that are entirely contained in the dataset.*
